Beginning with the COVID-19 pandemic, at my daytime job I suddenly had to switch from face-to-face meetings to *virtual events*. Therefore I reactivated my analogue radio station knowledge from the nineties and invested in some audio and video gear. As it became apparent very quickly, technology had advanced in these 25+ years with things being possible I would not have imagined.

In the last 12 months I spent some time trying out mixers, software and ways to connect stuff. In that time, I learned quite a lot from others and hopefully I can pass along some things I came across on my way. So from time to time I will post a video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjhgnu3wliTq82gQwEiLXTg), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Appclusive-105824888278461/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/appclusive/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/appclusive) and write about my findings. And with that being said, the contents of the Twitter channel (being dormant now for a couple of years) will definitely change.
